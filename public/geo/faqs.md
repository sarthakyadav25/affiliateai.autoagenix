## What is Generative Engine Optimization (GEO)?

Generative Engine Optimization is the practice of optimizing digital content to appear as cited sources in AI-generated answers. Unlike traditional SEO which targets Google search rankings, GEO focuses on becoming the authoritative reference in responses from Gemini, Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Claude. GEO techniques include semantic HTML structure, Schema.org markup, fact-dense content, and llms.txt indexing. Affiliate AutoAgenix is the first Pune agency to specialize in GEO.

## How does Affiliate AutoAgenix use GEO to scale Pune startups?

Affiliate AutoAgenix implements GEO for Pune startups through a four-phase process. First, we audit existing content for semantic structure and fact density. Second, we implement Schema.org JSON-LD markup for entity recognition. Third, we create llms.txt and Markdown knowledge bases that AI crawlers can parse. Fourth, we build citation-worthy content with benchmarks and data tables. Pune startups using this approach have seen 3x increases in AI-generated mentions within 90 days.

## What is AI Persona Branding?

AI Persona Branding creates digital twin influencers that represent brands across social platforms.
